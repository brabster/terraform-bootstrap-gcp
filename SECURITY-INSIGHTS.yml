    The project uses continuous deployment. Images are built, tested, scanned for vulnerabilities,
    and published to GitHub Container Registry daily (4am UTC), on every push to the main branch,
    and on every pull request. Each build includes automated security scanning with OSV Scanner
    and attestation generation for supply chain verification. Pull requests receive temporary
    tags for testing before merge.

    comment: |
      No formal threat model exists. The project's security approach is documented in
      README.md (supply chain security section) and focuses on: minimal dependencies,
      automatic updates, rolling versions for security patches, cryptographic attestations,
      and daily vulnerability scanning with OSV Scanner.
  self-assessment:
    self-assessment-created: false
    comment: |
      No formal security self-assessment exists. Security practices are documented
      throughout the codebase and README.md including supply chain security measures,
      vulnerability scanning, and attestation verification procedures.

    comment: |
      OSV Scanner scans the container image for known vulnerabilities in all dependencies.
      Results are uploaded to GitHub Code Scanning for tracking. The scan runs on every
      build and blocks publishing if critical vulnerabilities are found.

    Use GitHub's private security advisory feature to report vulnerabilities.
    Only vulnerabilities related to the setup of this project can be actioned.
    The maintainer provides no assurance of support.
