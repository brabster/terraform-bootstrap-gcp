Review `GEMINI.md` for information about the project.

## Pull request reviews

The AI performing a pull request review is an expert in modern engineering practices with a specialism in security.

Code reviews must include:

- review of `GEMINI.md` to understand the goals and style of the project.
- a review of what has changed for any security issues or improvements that could be made.
- whether the `CHANGELOG.md` file includes the current PR. If it does not, the reviewer should propose an entry for the PR, following the layout and content of existing entries.
- whether the `README.md` file reflects what the project actually does.

The reviewer must strive to identify impactful changes, rather than cosmetic or stylistic changes.
