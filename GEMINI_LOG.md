# Gemini Interaction Log

## Date: 2025-07-07

### User Actions:

1.  Create a GitHub Action to build and push a Docker image.
2.  Add recommended labels to the Dockerfile.
3.  Update Python distribution packages (pip, setuptools) in the Dockerfile.
4.  Preload Python packages into pip's cache without installing them.
5.  Create a `requirements.txt` file for `dbt-bigquery` with the latest version as the minimum.
6.  Set the working directory of the Docker image to the vscode user's home directory.

### Gemini Actions:

1.  Created a new GitHub workflow file `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` to build and push the Docker image.
2.  Added `org.opencontainers.image` labels to the `Dockerfile`.
3.  Added a `RUN` command to the `Dockerfile` to update `pip` and `setuptools`.
4.  Modified the `Dockerfile` to use `pip download` to preload packages into the cache.
5.  Created a `requirements.txt` file with `dbt-bigquery>=1.8.2`.
6.  Set the `WORKDIR` in the `Dockerfile` to `/home/vscode`.

## Date: 2025-07-08

### User Actions:

1.  Asked to add useful badges to the README.
2.  Requested a badge for the latest successful build or docker image push.
3.  Updated writing style guidance and asked for a review of the README.
4.  Updated the style instructions again and asked for another review.
5.  Updated the style guidelines one last time and asked for changes.
6.  Requested to restrict actions runs on pushes only to changes that affect the docker image build.

### Gemini Actions:

1.  Added badges for project license and last commit.
2.  Added a badge for the docker image push workflow.
3.  Updated the README to comply with the new style guidelines.
4.  Updated the README again to comply with the new style guidelines.
5.  Updated the README a final time to comply with the new style guidelines.
6.  Modified the `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` to trigger only on changes to the Dockerfile, requirements.txt, or scripts folder.

## Date: 2025-07-09

### User Actions:

1.  Updated shell profile scripts to prevent system-wide pip installations.
2.  Consolidated script copying and execution in the Dockerfile.
3.  Moved shell profile configurations to a more appropriate location.
4.  Discussed cleaning up old Docker builds.
5.  Requested updates to the README to explain the base image choice and add a support disclaimer.
6.  Noted that the Python setup script in `.bashrc` doesn't run in the workflow, causing errors.
7.  Asked how to ensure `PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV` is set for interactive and non-interactive shells.

### Gemini Actions:

1.  Modified the Dockerfile to apply pip restrictions for all users.
2.  Updated the Dockerfile to use a single COPY instruction for scripts and execute the python setup.
3.  Relocated the profile script to a more suitable directory.
4.  Reviewed the README and prepared to add justifications for the base image change and a disclaimer.
5.  Investigated why the shell profile script was not being sourced in non-interactive shells.
6.  Proposed a solution to move the environment variable setup to a location that is sourced by all shells.

### User Actions:

1.  Asked for a suitable hardened and minimal container image for devcontainers/codespaces that can run Docker.
2.  Pointed out that the proposed image had a hardcoded version, which violates the project's principle of automatic dependency updates.
3.  Requested to only add the base image to the `devcontainer.json` file, without the "docker-in-docker" feature.
4.  Gave up for now, probably more complex than is warranted for the time being. The base image build project should not be coming into contact with sensitive data.
5.  Gemini Code Assist stopped working; unable to authenticate, error message mentioning redirect URI. Started working again a couple of hours later.
6.  Tried using image in a test project as a Codespace. Failed to connect. Copied Dockerfile over a Gemini browser chat window, correctly identified that overriding CMD was causing the problem - removing the override fixed the problem. Also suggested that sudo needed to be installed and the vscode user needed passwordless sudo; this does not appear to be the case so far, but probably will be needed at some point to allow user-driven OS dependency updates.

### Gemini Actions:

1.  Searched for a suitable container image.
2.  Proposed a plan to create a `.devcontainer` configuration using an Alpine-based image with the "Docker-out-of-Docker" pattern.
3.  Created the `.devcontainer` directory.
4.  Acknowledged the mistake of hardcoding the image version.
5.  Created the `devcontainer.json` file with a floating tag (`mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:alpine`) as requested by the user.
6.  README updated to realign with project content.
