Generate a rules file template that I can base my rules files on.

Start the template with frontmatter including the initial prompt and a summary of any conversation that followed.

The rules template should have a structure that is optimised for an LLM to use as system context, yet also human readable. It should be applicable to a variety of topics such as testing strategy, functional programming, building docker images, python programming, data engineering etc. Some of these rules will be more technical in nature while others purely philosophical.

The target rules should generally stay short and concise (under 200 lines)

Have the template end with a section to reference important sources, then close with a TL;DR section at the end of the rules template!

Follow industry best practices and emerging patterns found on the internet for rules files when formulating this rules template!

Write the rules template to the prompts/rules directory as 00-rules-template.md.
