prompt: |
  Update the build process to check the status code of osv-scanner instead of using `|| true`. Return codes are describe in this link: https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/output/#return-codes. The build should succeed if there are 0 or more vulnerabilities found, but fail if there are any problems executing the scan. Avoid inline logic in the github action if possible.

# Feature Implementation Meta-Prompt

## 1. Clarification and Context

- **Clarifying Questions:** None. The request is clear.
- **Assumptions:** The user wants to improve the reliability of the vulnerability scanning process by handling errors from the `osv-scanner` tool more gracefully.
- **Goals & Non-Goals:**
    - **Goal:** Prevent the build from succeeding if the `osv-scanner` tool fails for reasons other than finding vulnerabilities.
    - **Goal:** Keep the GitHub Actions workflow file clean by moving the logic to a separate script.
    - **Non-Goal:** Change the vulnerability scanning tool.
    - **Non-Goal:** Change the format of the vulnerability report.

## 2. Pre-Mortem Analysis

- **Potential Showstoppers:** None identified.
- **External Dependencies:** The `osv-scanner` tool and its dependency on the OSV database.
- **Edge Cases:**
    - `osv-scanner` is not installed or not in the PATH.
    - The script is not executable.

## 3. Implementation Plan

- **High-Level Steps:**
    1. Create a new shell script that wraps the `osv-scanner` command.
    2. The script will execute the `osv-scanner` command and check its exit code.
    3. The script will exit with 0 if the `osv-scanner` exit code is 0 (no vulnerabilities) or 1 (vulnerabilities found).
    4. The script will exit with 1 if the `osv-scanner` exit code is anything else, indicating an error.
    5. Update the `docker-publish.yml` GitHub Actions workflow to use the new script.
- **Code-Level Changes:**
    - Create a new file `scripts/run_osv_scanner.sh`.
    - Make the new script executable.
    - Modify `docker-publish.yml` to call `scripts/run_osv_scanner.sh` instead of `osv-scanner ... || true`.
- **Data Model Changes:** None.

## 4. Validation and Testing

- **Automated Tests:**
    - Create a new test script (e.g., `tests/test_run_osv_scanner.sh`) that: 
        - Mocks `osv-scanner` to simulate different exit codes (0, 1, >1).
        - Calls `scripts/run_osv_scanner.sh` with the mocked `osv-scanner`.
        - Asserts the expected exit code from `scripts/run_osv_scanner.sh`.
    - Add a step to the GitHub Actions workflow to run this test script.
- **Integration Tests:** The change will be tested by running the `docker-publish.yml` workflow.
- **Manual Testing:**
    1. Run the `run_osv_scanner.sh` script with an image that has vulnerabilities to ensure it exits with 0.
    2. Run the `run_osv_scanner.sh` script with an invalid image name to ensure it exits with 1.
    3. Run the `run_osv_scanner.sh` script without `osv-scanner` installed to ensure it exits with 1.

## 5. Threat Model Impact

- **Summary of Changes:** This change significantly improves the security posture by ensuring that the build process fails if the vulnerability scanning tool encounters an error. Previously, the build would succeed even if the `osv-scanner` failed to execute correctly, potentially leading to the deployment of an unscanned or insecure image. The new approach forces immediate attention to scanner failures.
- **Asset Identification:** None.
- **Threat Identification:** This change mitigates the threat of undetected `osv-scanner` failures, which could lead to a false sense of security regarding image vulnerabilities.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** By failing the build on `osv-scanner` execution errors, we ensure that any issues with the scanning process are immediately visible and addressed, preventing the deployment of potentially unverified images.

## TL;DR

Create a new script `scripts/run_osv_scanner.sh` that wraps the `osv-scanner` command and checks the exit code. The script will exit with 0 if vulnerabilities are found (or not) and 1 if there is an error. Update the `docker-publish.yml` workflow to use this script. This will make the build more robust by failing on scanner errors while still allowing builds with vulnerabilities to succeed. Automated tests for the wrapper script will be added to the CI/CD pipeline to ensure its correct behavior across different `osv-scanner` exit scenarios. This change directly addresses the risk of undetected scanner failures, enhancing the overall security of the build process.
