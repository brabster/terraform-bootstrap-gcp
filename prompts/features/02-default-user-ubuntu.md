  Using template 00-feature-template.md and rules in rules, create an implementation plan for changing the default user in Dockerfile to the ubuntu user created by default with UID 1000, GID 1000 in the ubuntu:rolling image. Ensure that the docker-publish workflow is extended to check that the default user is ubuntu and has the correct UID/GID. Flag any potential issues with this approach in the devcontainer, Codespaces and GitHub actions contexts. Write the implementation plan to features and stop for review.

  Based on the user's request and an analysis of the repository, this plan outlines the steps to change the default user in the production Docker image to `ubuntu`.

# Feature Implementation: Default Docker User to `ubuntu`

## 1. Clarification and Context

- **Goals:**
  - Modify the root `Dockerfile` to set the default user to `ubuntu` (UID 1000, GID 1000).
  - The `ubuntu` user's home directory `/home/ubuntu` will be created and used as the working directory.
  - Extend the `docker-publish.yml` GitHub Actions workflow to include a test that verifies the user, UID, and GID in the built container image.

- **Assumptions:**
  - The `ubuntu:rolling` base image includes a user named `ubuntu` with UID 1000 and a group named `ubuntu` with GID 1000. This is standard for Ubuntu base images.
  - The change is targeted at the production/CI image defined in `/Dockerfile`, not the development container defined in `/.devcontainer/Dockerfile`.

- **Non-Goals:**
  - This change will not affect the user (`vscode`) or configuration of the dev container environment used for Codespaces.

## 2. Pre-Mortem Analysis

- **Potential Showstoppers:**
  - If the base image `ubuntu:rolling` changes and no longer includes the `ubuntu` user/group with the expected UID/GID, the build could fail. The planned verification step will catch this.

- **External Dependencies:**
  - The plan depends on the user/group configuration of the `docker.io/ubuntu:rolling` base image.

- **Potential Issues & Mitigations:**
  - **File Permissions:** Processes inside the container will run as the `ubuntu` user. The `Dockerfile` creates a pre-warmed pip cache, which will now be owned by `ubuntu`. This is the desired behavior and is not expected to cause issues.
  - **Dev Container Context:** There is no direct impact on the dev container or Codespaces, as they use `/.devcontainer/Dockerfile`, which is not being modified. This isolates the change to the production image.
  - **GitHub Actions Context:** The `docker-publish.yml` workflow is not affected by the user change *within* the image it builds. The new verification step will be added to the existing `image_test` job to ensure correctness.

## 3. Implementation Plan

- **High-Level Steps:**
  1.  Modify the root `Dockerfile` to remove the creation of the `vscode` user and switch to the `ubuntu` user.
  2.  Update the `docker-publish.yml` workflow to add a verification step for the user configuration.

- **Code-Level Changes:**

  - **File:** `/Dockerfile`
    - **Action:** Modify the final `RUN` command and subsequent `USER` and `WORKDIR` instructions.
    - **Current Snippet:**
      ```dockerfile
      RUN apt-get update \
          && ... \
          && /tmp/scripts/install_osv_scanner.sh \
          && useradd -ms /bin/bash vscode \
          && rm -rf /tmp/scripts

      USER vscode

      WORKDIR /home/vscode
      ```
    - **New Snippet:**
      ```dockerfile
      RUN apt-get update \
          && ... \
          && /tmp/scripts/install_osv_scanner.sh \
          && rm -rf /tmp/scripts

      USER ubuntu

      WORKDIR /home/ubuntu
      ```
    - **Rationale:** The `ubuntu` user is assumed to exist in the base image. The `WORKDIR` instruction will create the `/home/ubuntu` directory if it doesn't exist, but it will be owned by `root`. The subsequent `COPY` and `RUN` commands will be executed as the `ubuntu` user, which has write permissions in its home directory.

  - **File:** `/.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`
    - **Action:** Add user verification checks to the `image_test` job.
    - **Current Snippet (`image_test` job):**
      ```yaml
        - name: test
          run: |
            docker load -i ${{ runner.temp }}/candidate_image.tar
            docker run --rm candidate_image:latest bash -c " \
              set -e && \
              echo '--- Checking Terraform ---' && terraform --version && \
              echo '--- Checking gcloud ---' && gcloud --version && \
              echo '--- Checking Python ---' && python --version \
              echo '--- Checking osv-scanner ---' && osv-scanner --version \
            "
      ```
    - **New Snippet (`image_test` job):**
      ```yaml
        - name: test
          run: |
            docker load -i ${{ runner.temp }}/candidate_image.tar
            docker run --rm candidate_image:latest bash -c " \
              set -e && \
              echo '--- Checking Terraform ---' && terraform --version && \
              echo '--- Checking gcloud ---' && gcloud --version && \
              echo '--- Checking Python ---' && python --version && \
              echo '--- Checking osv-scanner ---' && osv-scanner --version && \
              echo '--- Checking user ---' && \
              if [ \"$(whoami)\" != 'ubuntu' ]; then echo 'User is not ubuntu'; exit 1; fi && \
              if [ \"$(id -u)\" != '1000' ]; then echo 'UID is not 1000'; exit 1; fi && \
              if [ \"$(id -g)\" != '1000' ]; then echo 'GID is not 1000'; exit 1; fi && \
              echo 'User checks passed.' \
            "
      ```

## 4. Validation and Testing

- **CI/CD:** The primary validation is the new test step in the `image_test` job of the `docker-publish.yml` workflow. A failure in this test will prevent the image from being published.
- **Manual:** An engineer can validate the change locally by building the image and running `docker run --rm -it <image_name> id` to inspect the user (`uid=1000(ubuntu) gid=1000(ubuntu) groups=1000(ubuntu)`).

## 5. Threat Model Impact

- **Summary of Changes:** The change replaces a custom non-root user (`vscode`) with a standard non-root user (`ubuntu`). This is a neutral change from a security standpoint and aligns with the principle of using standard, well-known configurations.
- **Asset Identification:** No new assets are introduced.
- **Threat Identification:** No new threats are introduced. The attack surface is substantively unchanged.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** The practice of using a non-root user is maintained.

## TL;DR

The plan is to modify the `Dockerfile` to use the standard `ubuntu` user (UID/GID 1000) instead of the custom `vscode` user. A verification step will be added to the `docker-publish.yml` CI workflow to ensure the user configuration is correct in all new image builds. This change is isolated to the production image and will not impact the Codespaces dev container.
